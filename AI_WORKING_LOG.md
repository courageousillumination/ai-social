Ok, I'm suitably impressed. There were a couple of hiccups along the way, but we got through a ton there. Supabase is sweet, vite is clean, and aider really covered a lot of boilerplate. A lot of it isn't important, but that's kind of the point. There are things in here I would structure differently, but we can work our way towards that. For our first attempt and 2 hours? Pretty good.
